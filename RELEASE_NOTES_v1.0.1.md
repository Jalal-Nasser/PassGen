# PassGen v1.0.1

This release focuses on polish and distribution.

## Highlights
- New Help → About PassGen dialog with version and quick links.
- Updated app icon and packaging so Windows refreshes pinned icons.
- Onboarding page is more responsive on small windows (scrollable, tighter spacing).
- Fixed splash/onboarding logo paths so assets render in production builds.

## Notes
